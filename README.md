# PRODIGY_SD_02
 Task - 2

Build a program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program should prompt the user to input their guess, compare it to the generated number, and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. It should continue until the user correctly guesses the number and then display the number of attempts it took to win the game.

What does this program do?
  A game where users guess a randomly generated number, receiving feedback until they succeed.

How does the program work?
1. Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

2. User Input: The user is prompted to guess the number.

3. Feedback: After each guess, the program tells the user whether their guess is too high or too low.

4. Repetition: The guessing continues until the user correctly guesses the number.

5. Attempts Count: Once the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of attempts it took.
